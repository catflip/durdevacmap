### How to create pin

![Task 1](readme-src/4.png)

First of all click the pin icon on the top left side of your screen, in the image above you see text "no. 1", and then after that you can see your pointer change into a pin just like you see on the image in the middle with the text "no. 2"

![Task 1](readme-src/5.png)

after you click a location on the map, you will be asked if you want to add the location or not, if you click "yes" the location will be added, if you click "no" the location will be removed, for now lets click "yes"
